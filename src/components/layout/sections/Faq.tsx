    question: 'How frequently is the sales data updated?',
    answer:
      'Actuals are synced monthly from the ERP system. Forecasts (Board OP3, OP6 LE, etc.) are updated after every regional finance review meeting.',
  },
  {
    question:
      'What do the different forecast versions (OP3, OP6, LE) represent?',
    answer:
      'OP represents the Operating Plan (Budget). OP3 is the board-approved plan established at the start of the year. LE stands for Latest Estimate; OP6 and OP9 are updated re-forecasts based on half-year and Q3 performance respectively.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is the YTD (Year-to-Date) growth calculated?',
    answer:
      'YTD growth is calculated by comparing the cumulative Actuals of the current fiscal year against the selected Target Measure (usually Board OP3 or Prior Year) for the same period.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I see a breakdown of sales by region or brand?',
    answer:
      'Yes, the "Brand Comparison" chart below the main KPIs allows you to compare performance across different brands or regions. For a full row-by-row breakdown, visit the Details page.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How are "Actuals" and "Forecast" values consolidated?',
    answer:
      'Data is consolidated using a standardized currency conversion rate set at the beginning of the fiscal year to ensure consistent comparison between regions without the volatility of daily exchange rates.',
